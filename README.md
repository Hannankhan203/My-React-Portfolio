# 💼 Personal Portfolio - React.js

This is my **personal portfolio website** built using **React.js**, designed to showcase my skills, featured projects, and provide a way for others to get in touch with me. The portfolio is **fully responsive** and includes smooth navigation, dark/light mode, and complete content. Recently, I have transitioned from using basic React to utilizing **React Router DOM** for better routing and navigation between different sections of the portfolio.
